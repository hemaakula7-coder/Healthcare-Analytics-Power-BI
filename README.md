# Healthcare-Analytics-Power-BI
End-to-end healthcare analytics project using Power BI, Power Query, and DAX
Healthcare Analytics Dashboard | Power BI Project
Excited to share my latest Power BI project focused on Healthcare Analytics.
In this project, I built an end-to-end dashboard to analyze:
🔹 Patient Admissions Trends
 🔹 Average Length of Stay
 🔹 Readmission Rate Analysis
 🔹 Department Risk & Efficiency Matrix
 🔹 Revenue Distribution by Payment Type
 🔹 Doctor Performance Analysis
Key Highlights:
✔ Data cleaning using Power Query
 ✔ Star schema data modeling
 ✔ Advanced DAX measures (CALCULATE, AVERAGEX, Time Intelligence)
 ✔ Conditional formatting for risk identification
 ✔ Top N filtering and performance benchmarking
This dashboard helps hospital management identify operational inefficiencies and readmission risks.
